# Images Directory

This directory contains all image assets for the TecNik website.

## Required Image Files

Make sure the following files are present in this directory:

- `combined-1200.webp`
- `combined3-300.webp`
- `combined3-600.webp`
- `donate.webp`
- `favicon.webp`
- `heart.gif`
- `heart.webp`
- `metaimg.webp`
- `noti.webp`
- `tecnikofficial.jpg`
- `tecnikofficial.webp`

## File Placement Instructions

1. Copy all image files from your original project's `assets/media/` folder to this `public/images/` directory
2. Make sure to maintain the original filenames exactly
3. Verify that all files are correctly placed before deployment

All image references in the code now use paths starting with `/images/`, so these files must be in this directory for the site to work correctly.
